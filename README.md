# GPS-Guided-Parachute

Our team undertook a project to design and implement an Automated Parachute Recovery System for model rockets. The system, centered around an Arduino microcontroller, integrated a custom made parachute, magnetometer, barometer, GPS module, LCD display, and servo motor to guide the rocket's parachute back to its initial launch point.

The core functionality involved custom making a parachute for rocket recovery while ensuring it followed a guided path back to the launch site. To achieve this, we developed a custom PCB to interconnect and streamline communication between the various modules, enabling them to fit compactly within the rocket's nose cone.

Key Features:

Arduino Control: The heart of our system, the Arduino microcontroller, coordinated and executed the recovery process based on real-time sensor data.

Magnetometer and Barometer: We integrated a magnetometer for accurate directional sensing and a barometer to measure altitude, allowing precise monitoring of the rocket's descent.

GPS Tracking: A GPS module was incorporated to determine the rocket's exact location, facilitating a guided return trajectory to the launch site.

LCD Display: To enhance user interaction and provide real-time information, we integrated an LCD display, offering critical data such as altitude, distance to home, direction of home, and GPS coordinates during the recovery phase.

Servo Mechanism: A servo motor was employed to control the length of the left and right parachute control strings by pulling on either the left or right control strings, ensuring a controlled descent and enabling adjustments based on sensor inputs for left turns, right turns, and forward movement.

Custom PCB Design: We designed and manufactured a custom printed circuit board (PCB) to connect and organize the various modules efficiently, optimizing space within the limited confines of the rocket's nose cone.

Outcome:

The Automated Parachute Recovery System successfully demonstrated its capabilities in multiple test launches. The precise control afforded by the integrated technologies ensured a targeted descent, contributing to the successful recovery of our model rockets. The custom PCB design not only facilitated compact integration but also allowed for scalability and future enhancements.

This project represents a significant advancement in rocket recovery systems, showcasing the potential for guided parachute solutions in the realm of amateur rocketry and aerospace engineering instead of guided rockets themselves.
